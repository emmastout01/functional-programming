# Functional programming

## What is functional programming, anyway?
- Programming paradigm: a way of thinking about code
- Some key concepts: 
    - Data flows through pure functions
    - Avoid shared state
    - Immutable data
- Itâ€™s declarative: Written more like people think, and less like computers think


## Why use functional programming
- Potentially easier to make sense of 
- Potentially easier to debug; prevents bugs associated with mutable data 
- Easier to test
- Pure functions can be memoized for performance
